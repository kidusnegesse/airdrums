# Air Drums

This project simulates a drum set by using an Arduino Uno and accelerometers attached to drum sticks and shoes. It plays drum sounds by writing MIDI drum notes to the Arduino serial port when an acceleration threshold is crossed on the accelerometers. An MIDI interface, such as The Hairless MIDI, is able to receive and output the notes as sound.

Accelerometer attached to left drumstick connected at A0 pin plays snare.

Accelerometer attached to right drumstick connected at A1 plays high hat.

Accelerometer attached to right foot connected at A2 plays bass drum.
