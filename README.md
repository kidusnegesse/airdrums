# Air Drums

This project simulates a drum set using accelerometers attached to drum sticks, pedals, feet, etc. It plays drum sounds when an acceleration threshold is crossed by writing drum notes to serial port. An MIDI interface, such as The Hairless MIDI, is able to receive and output the notes as sound.

Accelerometer attached to left drumstick connected at A0 pin plays snare.

Accelerometer attached to right drumstick connected at A1 plays high hat.

Accelerometer attached to right foot connected at A2 plays bass drum.
